There are many additional features offered through the extension

### Localization

By default, the extension uses the browser's locale to display the `<mapml-viewer>` UI in the user's locale. 

### Feature Indexing

When turned on through the extension, enables a square in the middle of the map to enable a keyboard index menu of features located inside the square.

### Announce Move and Zoom

When toggled through the extension, announces the map movement and zoom through screen readers.

### Rendering text/mapml resources

When turned on through the extension popup, the extension enables the rendering of map documents that have no host document, just as browsers can render image resources (image/*) that have no host document.
